You need the Adafruit_NeoPixel library to use the code.

The code makes different effects for the 12 LED RGB Wheel.
The wheel needs to be connected with GND and 5V of the arduino (at least it has to have the same ground) and be on pin 6 for data transmission.
I recommend having buttons on pin 3, 4 and 5 for mode, speed and brightness of the wheel/effects.
